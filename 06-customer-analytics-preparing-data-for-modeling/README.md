# Customer Analytics: Preparing Data for Modeling

You've been hired by a major online data science training provider to store their data much more efficiently, so they can create a model that predicts if course enrollees are looking for a job. You'll convert data types, create ordered categories, and filter ordered categorical data so the data is ready for modeling.

## Project Instructions

The Head Data Scientist at *Training Data Ltd*. has asked you to create a DataFrame called `ds_jobs_transformed` that stores the data in `customer_train.csv` much more efficiently. Specifically, they have set the following requirements:

- Columns containing categories with only two factors must be stored as Booleans (`bool`).
- Columns containing integers *only* must be stored as 32-bit integers (`int32`).
- Columns containing floats must be stored as 16-bit floats (`float16`).
- Columns containing nominal categorical data must be stored as the `category` data type.
- Columns containing ordinal categorical data must be stored as *ordered* categories, and not mapped to numerical values, with an order that reflects the natural order of the column.
- The DataFrame should be filtered to only contain students with *10 or more years* of experience at companies with *at least 1000 employees*, as their recruiter base is suited to more experienced professionals at enterprise companies.

If you call `.info()` or `.memory_usage()` methods on `ds_jobs` and `ds_jobs_transformed` after you've preprocessed it, you should notice a substantial decrease in memory usage.
