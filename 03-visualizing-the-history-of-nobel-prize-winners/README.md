# Visualizing the History of Nobel Prize Winners
Explore a dataset containing a century's worth of Nobel Laureates. Who won? Who got snubbed? Use data manipulation and visualization skills to explore the history of this coveted prize.

## Project Instructions
Analyze Nobel Prize winner data and identify patterns by answering the following questions:

What is the most commonly awarded gender and birth country?

- Store your answers as string variables `top_gender` and `top_country`.

Which decade had the highest ratio of US-born Nobel Prize winners to total winners in all categories?

- Store this as an integer called `max_decade_usa`.

Which decade and Nobel Prize category combination had the highest proportion of female laureates?

- Store this as a dictionary called `max_female_dict` where the decade is the key and the category is the value. There should only be one key:value pair.

Who was the first woman to receive a Nobel Prize, and in what category?

- Save your string answers as `first_woman_name` and `first_woman_category`.

Which individuals or organizations have won more than one Nobel Prize throughout the years?

- Store the full names in a list named `repeat_list`.
