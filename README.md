# Data Analysis Portfolio

This repository collects my data analysis projects (mostly from DataCamp and self-initiated),
each in its own folder as a Jupyter Notebook.

## Structure
- `projects/<project_name>/notebook.ipynb`
- optional `data/` with small sample datasets (<100MB)
- `environment.yml` for reproducibility

## Projects
| Project Name | Project Description | Skills Applied |
|---------------|----------------------|------------------|
| Analyzing Students' Mental Health | Use data manipulation skills to perform exploratory data analysis on a dataset around student mental health. | SQL |
| Exploring NYC Public School Test Result Scores | Use data manipulation and summary statistics to analyze test scores across New York City's public schools. | Python |
| Visualizing the History of Nobel Prize Winners | Explore a dataset containing a century's worth of Nobel Laureates. Who won? Who got snubbed? Use data manipulation and visualization skills to explore the history of this coveted prize. | Python |
| Analyzing Crime in Los Angeles | Serve as a data detective, supporting the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) in analyzing crime data to guide how they should allocate resources to protect the people of their city. Find out when and where crime is most likely to occur, along with the types of crimes commonly committed in LA. | Python |
| Investigating Netflix Movies | Explore Netflix movie data and perform exploratory data analysis for a production company to uncover insights about movies from a particular decade. Apply the foundational Python skills learned in Introduction to Python and Intermediate Python by manipulating and visualizing movie data. | Python |
| Customer Analytics: Preparing Data for Modeling | You've been hired by a major online data science training provider to store their data much more efficiently, so they can create a model that predicts if course enrollees are looking for a job. You'll convert data types, create ordered categories, and filter ordered categorical data so the data is ready for modeling. | Python |
