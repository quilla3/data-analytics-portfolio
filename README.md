This repository collects my data analysis projects (mostly from DataCamp and self-initiated),
each in its own folder as a Jupyter Notebook.

## Structure
- `projects/<project_name>/notebook.ipynb`
- optional `data/` with small sample datasets (<100MB)
- `environment.yml` for reproducibility

## Projects
