# Data Analysis Portfolio

This repository is a growing collection of **data analysis projects** and **workbooks** that demonstrate practical skills in data cleaning, analysis, and visualization using Python and SQL.  

Each project explores real-world datasets, applying statistical and analytical techniques to extract insights and tell data-driven stories.
